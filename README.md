# Angular-JS
Angular is not a tool which allows us to write static HTML file,It allows us to mix static HTML code and dynamic thing that we want in the output of the code (possibly styling and typescript)
##  Data Binding
##  String Interpolation
### Ctrl+C
    Used to close the developing process
    When we load the **.html** file,
   **app-root** dynamically injects the script in the **.HTML** file.
   **app-root** is a selector created in the typescript file basically it is like own created tag.
### Routing
With **Routing** we can manage the use of different URLs,to the user it will apear that we are changing the page but technically we are on the same page.
**HTTP** Angular can't connect to the database directly but it can connect to the web server which will connect to the database which can be used to store the data

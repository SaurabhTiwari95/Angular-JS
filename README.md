# Angular-JS
Angular is not a tool which allows us to write static HTML file,It allows us to mix static HTML code and dynamic thing that we want in the output of the code (possibly styling and typescript)
##  Data Binding
##  String Interpolation
### Ctrl+C
   Used to close the developing process
   When we load the **.html** file,**app-root** dynamically injects the script in the **.HTML** file.
   **app-root** is a selector created in the typescript file basically it is like own created tag.
### Routing
With **Routing** we can manage the use of different URLs,to the user it will apear that we are changing the page but technically we are on the same page.
**HTTP** Angular can't connect to the database directly but it can connect to the web server which will connect to the database which can be used to store the data
## TypeScript
It is a superset of JavaScript,It offers more features than JS.
It doesn't run in the browser it is Compiled into JS and that JS is compiled into browser which is held by CLI that is why we need the CLI.
